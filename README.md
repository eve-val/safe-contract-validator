## Purpose

This is a Google Apps script used in the [Nobody in Local [SA.FE]][2]
[loot buy program][3] in [EVE Online][4].

It uses the [EVE XML API][5] to fetch data about all of the contracts assigned
to SA.FE and then validates them against a set of rules and the matching data
from the [evepraisal.com API][6].  The results are returned as a 2-D array
suitable for display in a spreadsheet.
